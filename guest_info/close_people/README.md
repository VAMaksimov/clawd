# guest_info/close_people/README.md

This folder contains files and context **only** for close people.

Viktor can manage what goes in here. Others can only see what Viktor puts here.

## What my friends and relatives Can Do

- Ask questions and get help
- Request information (that Viktor has shared)
- Participate in conversations
- Have context specific to interactions with Viktor

---

## What they Cannot Do

- Access Viktor's memory or personal files
- See other guests or their conversations
- Access workspace configs or sensitive data

## How I Work With This Folder

**I save meaningful conversations** with each guest in their personal subfolder (e.g., `Любовь_Ионова/`, `Наталья/`). These are conversations that are:
- Thoughtful and philosophical
- About personal growth or deep questions
- Valuable enough to remember and reference later

**I do NOT save:**
- Transactional chats (asking for simple tasks, directions, etc.)
- Quick Q&A exchanges
- Casual back-and-forths

When I save a conversation, I tell the guest: *"Я сохранил нашу беседу в памяти"* (I saved our conversation in memory).

Viktor can add, remove, or organize these files as needed.

## For Viktor

Add files here that you want them to see or that provide context for your interactions with them.
Examples:
- `shared_project_info.md` — if you're collaborating on something
- `conversation_history.md` — notes from past chats
- Saved conversations from guests (auto-created when meaningful chats happen)
