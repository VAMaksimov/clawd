Hi, I'm trying to repair the ubuntu after update (kernel panic error when trying to boot). I loaded my USB image with 'try ubuntu', did: sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount --bind $i /mnt$i; done sudo chroot /mnt After apt install --reinstall linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic I get make -j4 KERNELRELEASE=6.17.0-14-generic -C /lib/modules/6.17.0-14-generic/build M=/var/lib/dkms/virtualbox/7.0.16/build...(bad exit status: 2) ERROR: Cannot create report: [Errno 17] File exists: '/var/crash/virtualbox-dkms.0.crash' Error!

assistant: You're stuck because **VirtualBox DKMS won't compile against the new kernel, which is blocking dpkg from finishing**. The kernel itself is fine—the blocker is VirtualBox.

Quick fix (still in chroot):

```bash
# First, remove the VirtualBox package that's causing the cascade failure
sudo apt remove --purge virtualbox-dkms virtualbox

# Now reconfigure the stuck kernel packages
sudo dpkg --configure -a

# Then try the broken install again
sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

If that works, you have two paths:
1. **Reinstall VirtualBox** after the kernel is stable (it'll compile cleanly against 6.8.0-100)
2. **Skip VirtualBox entirely** if you don't need it—one less DKMS headache on updates

Does VirtualBox matter to your setup, or can you drop it?

```

I think I can install it later when I need it
assistant: Good call. Go ahead with:

```bash
sudo apt remove --purge virtualbox-dkms virtualbox
sudo dpkg --configure -a
sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

After that completes cleanly, you should be able to:
1. Exit the chroot
2. Reboot from your normal drive
3. System should come up on the 6.8.0-100 kernel

When you need VirtualBox later, just `apt install virtualbox` and it'll compile cleanly against whatever kernel you're running then.

Let me know if you hit anything else in those steps.

The dpkg --list | grep linux-image returns: rc linux-image-6.14.0-35-generic 6.14.0-35.35~24.04.1 amd64 Signed kernel image generic rc linux-image-6.14.0-36-generic 6.14.0-36.36~24.04.1 amd64 Signed kernel image generic ii linux-image-6.14.0-37-generic 6.14.0-37.37~24.04.1 amd64 Signed kernel image generic ii linux-image-6.17.0-14-generic 6.17.0-14.14~24.04.1 amd64 Signed kernel image generic rc linux-image-6.8.0-100-generic 6.8.0-100.100 amd64 Signed kernel image generic ii linux-image-generic-hwe-24.04 6.17.0-14.14~24.04.1 amd64 Generic Linux kernel image Will it boot with this images? And I exit chroot with ctrl + D?
assistant: **Boot status:**
- `ii` = installed (will boot)
- `rc` = removed/config (won't boot)

You have two kernels ready to boot:
- **6.14.0-37-generic** (stable, old)
- **6.17.0-14-generic** (current default, should work now that VirtualBox is gone)

The 6.8.0-100 is marked `rc`, so it's partially removed—won't boot. If you want that one back later, you'd reinstall it.

**After dpkg finishes:** exit chroot with `exit` (or Ctrl+D), then:
```bash
sudo umount -R /mnt
sudo reboot
```

It should boot to 6.17.0-14 by default. If it doesn't, grub will let you pick 6.14.0-37 as fallback.

If 6.17.0-14 boots cleanly, you're done. If you want 6.8.0-100 back later, that's a separate `apt install linux-image-6.8.0-100-generic`.
